#The analysis I want to do for my project is to see if there is a correlation between the Genome Size and the rate of Net Diversification in different species of Gymnosperm.
#The data that is used in the analysis is the genome size of 420 different species of Gymnosperm plants that are put into a Phlylogenetic tree based on the genome size 
#With the Phylogenetic Tree, I will use that to perform a Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures to make estimates of the net diversification across the species of gymnosperm.  
#Finally, the estimates that is found, will be used to find the p-value to check to see if there is a correlation between the Genome Size and the rate of Net Diversification.
